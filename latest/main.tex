\begin{abstract}
 We present the adiabatic regime for the particles interacting with the frequency chirping waves in the inhomogeneous magnetic field. 
 Despite the rapid change of the parameters during the interaction, we show that the adiabatic invariant is conserved as long as the particles stay trapped in the reference frame moving with the resonance.
Assuming the trapped particle distribution as a function of the adiabatic invariant and  the water-bag approximation, we derive an analytic form of the nonlinear current as a function of  the inhomogeneous parameter that describes the frequency chirping and inhomogeneities in the background magnetic field.
The nonlinear current expression  is also examined in the  Vlasov hybrid simulations
and the simulation results show that  the nonlinear current can be well described by the adiabatic water bag approximation  except for the chirping onset stage and the source region where the adiabatic approximation is invalid.
