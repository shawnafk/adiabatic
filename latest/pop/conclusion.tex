\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}
In summary, we have explored the dynamics of resonant electrons and the evolution of whistler-mode chorus waves by test particle simulations.
We show that the adiabatic description is valid if one tracks the dynamics in the frame of reference moving the local resonance.
We have derived an analytic current expression and discussed the adiabatic regime in the global domain by showing the wave chirping behavior with respect to the inhomogeneity parameter $\alpha$.
The adiabatic approximation and the reduced current expression reveal the underlying physics for the wave chirping.
