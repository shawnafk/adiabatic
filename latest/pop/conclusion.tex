In summary, we analyze adiabaticity in magnetospheric chorus waves using test particle simulations. By synchronizing with the real-time chirping wave, we calculate the adiabatic invariant, revealing variations across reference frames and regions. Near the equator, adiabaticity is compromised due to particle release. Finally, we validate our findings with a simplified energetic trapped particle current and Vlasov simulation.
